export const generalInfo = `I love coding, because that's where I'm able to try out and learn
          something new. The fact that I'm able to apply my knowledge in
          practice and create products brings both joy and pride to me. I like
          to learn new things, because I prefer to learn the way they are
          working rather than just memorising them. In this way, I can
          successfully think creatively and go to a higher level in order to
          improve the quality of my work. I always focus on writing my codes in
          accordance with the " Clean Code '' principle. While I've been
          learning new things, I also found out that there is a limitless ocean
          of knowledge. But thanks to my interest to learn, apply and create new
          things, I really want to swim in this ocean.`;
